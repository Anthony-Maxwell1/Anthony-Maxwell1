## How did I make this ReadMe?

My readme is structured of multiple components.

- The frontend README.md
  - Designed to point to the svgs and animated files.
- The backend Github Actions & python code.
  - Generates the SVGs and Animations.
  - The OS X desktop environment effect was stolen from my other project, schoolm8, and mutilated to only get that specific theme.
- The middle-man: Vercel
  - Very simple, it's designed to redirect you to a new readme/SVGs each time, allowing random effects to be displayed.
